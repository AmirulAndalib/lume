 * @element lume-point-light
 * @class PointLight -
 *
 * Element: `<lume-point-light>`
 *
 * An element that illuminates objects near it, casting shadows in any direction
 * away from the light by default. The light element itself is not visible; to
 * visualize it you can place a sphere as a child of the light for example.
 *
 * The light's shadow projection camera is a PerspectiveCamera with fov of 90,
 * with aspect of 1.
 *
 * All mesh elements [receive](../meshes/Mesh#receiveshadow) or
 * [cast](../meshes/Mesh#castshadow) shadows by default.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * <div id="example"></div>
 *
 * <script type="application/javascript">
 *   new Vue({
 *     el: '#example',
 *     template: '<live-code :template="code" mode="html>iframe" :debounce="200" />',
