## Project goal

A high quality rendering Engine, designed for real world use.  Built
in tandem with high quality, reuseable components, to ensure relevance.

**Coding Goals**: See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Getting started

* `npm i && jspm i` - install deps (before building/testing)
* `npm run build` - build to `dist/`
* `npm run dev` - file watcher with browser sync
* `npm run test` - including code coverage in `coverage/`
* `npm run test:perf` - performance tests, results in `benchmarks/`

## Disclaimers

This is my first time using ES6, ES6 modules, jspm, gulp, etc.  All my
experience is with Meteor (before that, PHP; I skipped node.js before
using Meteor).

I'm not opinionated with anything regarding the above, neither style
nor library choices - I just picked what I found quickly and made
sense.
