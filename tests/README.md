Testing is sparse but we're working on having much better coverage! Thanks for your patience.

To run the tests, simply do

```
	npm test
```

To run the tests in your browser, set up a local directory server and navigate to 

```
http://localhost:port/node_modules/intern/client.html?config=tests/intern
```
