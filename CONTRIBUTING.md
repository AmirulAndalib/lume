I bet you're looking for more tests! We're working on them :-)

If you're brave enough to contribute still, please make sure to 

* Use the same coding style as the rest of the codebase.

* Only change the source files necessary. We'll build the distribution bundles, documentation, etc. upon a new release.

* Make your pull request to the `master` branch. So please
rebase your pull request on `master` if `master` has changed. 

* Please squash your commits and leave a well-formed commit messages.

* Ask the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/samsarajs) if you have any questions.
