This showcases a side menu demo. It incorporates gestures, physics transitions, native scrolling, transforms in 3D space
and coordinated animations.

## Installation

Open `index.html` in your browser. That's it!

To view this demo on a mobile device, go to [goo.gl/nhRGeg](http://goo.gl/nhRGeg)

## Documentation

If you open `docs/main.html` in your browser you will see pretty documentation, rendered with [docco](https://jashkenas.github.io/docco/).

##Bundling

If you'd like to bundle the application into a single JavaScript file, run the following:
 
```
	npm install
	npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory with a bundled `app.js` and minified `app.min.js` files. Keep in mind
you will need to copy over other assets, such as images, fonts, CSS and the index.html file.
